## Little bit about me:


Before joining App Academy, I worked as an insurance service representative, finding fulfillment in providing assurance to customers but feeling a sense of passionless fulfillment. This led to self-discovery and a rediscovery of my passion for software engineering, eventually leading me to App Academy. I've since undergone significant personal growth, recognizing technical strengths such as debugging, communication, and teamwork, alongside non-technical strengths like passion for software development and accountability. I find debugging particularly enjoyable due to its requirement for patience, persistence, and deep knowledge. I value level-headed teamwork in others, aligning with my own persistence. As someone who enjoys volunteer work, I seek opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals in local charities and non-profit organizations. My professional narrative combines diverse experiences as a senior insurance service representative and a mechanic shop foreman, where I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and leadership skills, now leveraged in software engineering to drive innovation and hopefully make a meaningful impact.
